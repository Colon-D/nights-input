The majority of this repository is Reloaded II's mod template.
Functions were decompiled from the game.

Anything that differs from the template, and wasn't decompiled from the game, should be made by me.

Anything made by me is under the [WTFPL-69.420](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sean-clayton/WTFPL-69.420/master/WTFPL-69.420.txt) license.
